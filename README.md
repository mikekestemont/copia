# copia
Bias correction for richness in abundance data

For development, run 

``` bash
pip install -e . 
```

in the top directory of `copia`.

Subsequently, run `pytest` from the same directory. 

## Etymology
Because this package targets so-called "abundance" data from ecology, it has been named using the corresponding Latin term *copia*. The artwork for the logo has been kindly contributed by Dr. Lauren Fonteyn (Leiden University, NL). The depicted goat is a mythological reference to the [cornucopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornucopia) or "horn of plenty", the legendary horn of the goat Amaltheia, who fed the infant Zeus with her milk.
