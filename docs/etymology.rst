Because this package targets so-called "abundance" data from ecology, it has been named
using the corresponding Latin term copia. The artwork for the logo has been kindly
contributed by Dr. Lauren Fonteyn (Leiden University, NL). The depicted goat is a
mythological reference to the cornucopia or "horn of plenty", the legendary horn of the
goat Amaltheia, who fed the infant Zeus with her milk.
