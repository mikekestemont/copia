    Chao1 estimate of bias-corrected species richness

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array-like of shape (number of species)
        An array representing the observed abundances (observed
        counts for each individual species. 

    Returns
    -------
    richness : float
        Estimate ($\hat{f_0}$) of the bias-corrected species richness:

        $\hat{f_0} = \left\{\begin{aligned}
        \frac{(n - 1)}{n} \frac{f_1^2}{(2f_2)} \qquad if f_2 > 0;\\
        \frac{(n - 1)}{n} \frac{f_1(f_1 - 1)}{2} \qquad if f_2 = 0
        \end{aligned}$

            - $f_1$ = the number of species sighted exactly once in
            the sample (singletons),
            - $f_2$ = the number of species that were sighted twice
            (doubletons)
            - $n$ = the observed, total sample size.
            - $\hat{f_0}$ = the estimated lower bound for the number
            of species that do exist in the assemblage, but which were
            sighted zero times, i.e. the number of undetected species.
